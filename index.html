			<div class="uno"> <p>Targaryen dragons are mysterious creatures in the world of A Song of Ice and Fire that are mostly known for being weapons for war for House Targaryen.</p></div>
			<div class="dos"><p>In HBO's upcoming House of the Dragon series, we can expect Targaryen dragons to take center stage as vital pieces of the Dance of the Dragons, a civil war between factions of House Targaryen.</p></div>
			<div class="tres"><p>Unlike Game of Thrones, House of the Dragon is going to feature a ton of dragons which will get confusing if you don’t know who’s who. So, in this list of Targaryen dragons, you’ll know who rides which dragon and how important they are to the war.</p></div>
		</div>
		<div class="input"><p>Fans may have been unhappy with the ending of the original Game of Thrones series, but it made us interested enough in the <a href="https://www.alittlebithuman.com/tracing-the-targaryen-family-tree/" target="_blank">Targaryen family</a> to give House of the Dragon a chance. House of the Dragon isn’t just about the Targaryens though, it’s also about the dragons that they’ve relied on to maintain power. In A Song of Ice and Fire, Targaryen dragons are engines of war and companions to their riders. They shape the course of Westeros’ history but are also intimately tied to the fate of the Targaryen they bond with.</p></div>

			<h3>Meet 5 Important Targaryen Dragons Ahead of House of the Dragon</h3>
		</div>
		<div id="vermithor"><p> Vermithor</p></div>
		<div>
			<img  class="pic" src="img/vermithor.jpg" alt="Vermithor">
		</div>
		<div class="pin"><p>&#10568;Vermithor was known as “The Bronze Fury” because of his bronze-like scales and tan wings, making him a desirable dragon for anyone who wanted a leg up in the Dance of the Dragons. However, Vermithor was a difficult dragon to tame. Unlike other Targaryen dragons who were easier to ride after having a previous rider, Vermithor was hostile to anyone who tried to ride him. But when he was needed during the Dance, Vermithor allowed a bastard Targaryen, who worked as a blacksmith, to ride him.&#10568;</p></div>
		<div class="vision"><p>This seems to be a parallel to how Jaehaerys I chose a blacksmith’s son, Septon Barth, to be his Hand of the King because of his merits. This had never been done before as previous Targaryen kings chose their own relatives to be their Hand.</p></div>
		<div id="caraxes"><p>2. Caraxes</p></div>
		<div class="dragon">
			<img src="img/caraxes.png" height="382" width="523" alt="Caraxes">
		</div>
		<div class="pin"><p>&#10568;Caraxes was a red dragon said to be half the size of Vhagar, Queen Visenya’s dragon, making him one of the smaller adult Targaryen dragons to fight in the Dance. However, he was still thrice the size of younger dragons and was known as “The Blood Wyrm,” implying that he had a fearsome reputation. Caraxes’ first rider was Aemon Targaryen, the son of Jaeharys I and Queen Alysanne.&#10568;</p></div>
		<div id="silverwing"><p>3. Silverwing </p></div>
		<div>
			<img  class="pic" src="img/silverwings.jpg" alt="Silverwing">
		</div>
		<div class="pin"><p>&#10568;Silverwing was originally the dragon of Queen Alysanne Targaryen who is sometimes referred to as Good Queen Alysanne. The two had a close bond since childhood and practically grew up together. Some accounts say that Silverwing hatched in Alysanne’s cradle. True to her name, Silverwing had silver scales and shared her rider’s temperament. Many of the Targaryen dragons share personality traits with their original rider and in Silverwing’s case, it made her friendly like Queen Alysanne.&#10568;</p></div>
		<div id="sunfyre"><p>4. Sunfyre</p></div>
		<div><img class="tale" src="img/sunfyre.jpg" alt="Sunfyre"></div>
		<div class="loop"><p>Sunfyre was famous for his golden scales and was said to be the most beautiful dragon to ever be seen in Westeros. Though nowhere near as large as Vermithor, it’s implied that Sunfyre was larger than many of his contemporaries. Sunfyre was the dragon of Aegon II Targaryen, the son of King Viserys I, who fought his sister Rhaenyra Targaryen for the Iron Throne. Aegon and Sunfyre would be left permanently injured by one of the battles during the Dance. In fact, many of the battle injuries they suffer are similar to each other.</p></div>
		<div id="tessarion"><p>5. Tessarion</p></div>
		<div><img class="tale" src="img/tessarion.jpg" alt="Tessarion"></div>
		<div class="loop"><p>Tessarion was the dragon of Prince Daeron Targaryen, a younger brother of Aegon II Targaryen. Prince Daeron’s disappearance during the Dance leads to several conspiracy theories and claims later during the Dance and even after it. Tessarion was called “The Blue Queen” because of her dark blue wings and blue flames. Like Sunfyre, Tessarion was a beautiful dragon that had copper claws and belly scales. Because she was a young dragon, Tessarion wasn’t known for her size, but for her speed. She wasn’t the fastest, but she was far more nimble than the older Targaryen dragons in the Dance. Tessarion played a vital role in the Battle of Honeywine, singlehandedly winning the fight together with Prince Daeron.</p></div>
		<div class="hidden"><p>If there’s one thing to look out for in House of the Dragon, it’s the chase scene between Tessarion and Seasmoke. Though, that’s assuming HBO doesn’t cut corners like they did in Game of Thrones.</p></div>

		<div><p>The last dragon was, well, the last dragon of House Targaryen before Daenerys Stormborn returned to Westeros with her three dragons. As mentioned before, the Targaryen dragons often serve as mirrors of the history of House Targaryen who themselves parallel the present-day events of Game of Thrones.&#128009;</p></div>
